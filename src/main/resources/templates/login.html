              Provided that you are eligible to use the App, you are granted a limited license to access and use<br />
              the App and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly<br />

              USER REPRESENTATIONS<br />
              By using the App, you represent and warrant that: (1) all registration information you submit will<br />
              be true, accurate, current, and complete; (2) you will maintain the accuracy of such information<br />
              and promptly update such registration information as necessary; (3) you have the legal capacity<br />
              and you agree to comply with these Terms of Use; (4) you are not under the age of 13; (5) not a<br />
              minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside, or if a minor, you have received parental permission<br />

              right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the App<br />
              (or any portion thereof).<br />
              USER REGISTRATION<br />
              You may be required to register with the App. You agree to keep your password confidential and<br />
              will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right to remove,<br />
              reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such<br />
              username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.<br />
              USER CONDUCT<br />
              By using our App, you agree to conduct yourself in a respectful manner. Any conduct which is<br />
              considered to be disrespectful will be marked by the user receiving a &lsquo;yellow card&rsquo; as a warning.<br />
              This yellow card will be applied to that user&rsquo;s registration for one week from the date of issue.<br />
              Example of conduct that would earn a yellow card is; posting excessively lengthy voice messages<br />
              on the platform.<br />
              If a user receives a second yellow card within a week of the first yellow card being awarded, they<br />
              will be issued with a &lsquo;red card&rsquo; and given a 1 match day ban meaning the use will be unable to<br />
              use the app or post during a match.</p>

            <p>If we consider a user&rsquo;s conduct to be significantly below the standards expected, we can issue an<br />
              automatic red card. Offences that will incur an automatic red card include; racisim, homophobia,<br />
              sexual content being posted, violent or disturbing images or clips.<br />
              At our sole discretion, if we consider a user&rsquo;s conduct to be consistently in breach of these rules<br />
              (or if any user makes any direct threats to another user or their family) we can implement a lifetime<br />
              ban for the offending user.<br />
              Any sanction imposed by us can be appealed within 4 working days of the sanction being<br />
              imposed. This appeal will be considered by us, and our decision is final. We shall aim to provide<br />
